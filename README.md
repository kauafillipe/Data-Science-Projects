## :zap:	 3 - PokeTuring

The idea of this project was to apply some of Streamlit tools in a web application. I decided to use it on a Pokemon dataset.

Then, running __poke.py__ you'll see the result of my efforts to visualize some cool information about Pokemons and try to understad some factors which might
affect if they're legendary or not, to create a kind of a Pokedex and, at last, to predict if a Pokemon is legendary or not based on some of its aspects.

It may be a little bit confusing for those who're not familiar with Pokemon world, so I suggest you check the Kaggle webwsite where I've found the dataset 
(so you can understand it better). But, anyway, I'll try to explain the main stats I play with using Streamlit, so you don't get lost:
